        <p class="basic-text-font">The world is evolving at a very fast pace. The current scenario demands the ability to learn, unlearn and relearn things. It has always remained a challenge for academia to produce industry-ready people. At UIET, our mission is to produce professionally competent engineers by providing value-based and quality education to students and to make them adaptable to ever-changing demands and requirements of the world. The prime strengths of the institute are the highly competent students, dedicated and research-oriented faculty, staff and the state of the art infrastructure. Within a short span of time, UIET has proved its mettle by securing 59th position among the best engineering colleges in India and has set itself apart as an institute of repute in North India. We share a wonderful relationship with industry as they continue to seek our assistance in various projects where our students participate actively. Today, we have a strong alumni base with presence in almost every major company of the corporate world. We have always fulfilled the expectations of our past recruiters and hope to give our best this year also. We encourage all private and government sector companies to participate in the recruitment process and we are sure that the students recruited will play a pivotal role in the growth of the respective organization.</p>
